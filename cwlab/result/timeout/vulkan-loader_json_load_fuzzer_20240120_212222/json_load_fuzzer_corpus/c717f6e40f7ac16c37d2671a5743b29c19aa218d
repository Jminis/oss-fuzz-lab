By design, minimal error checking is done inside a Vulkan driver. Applications have full control and responsibility for correct operation. Any errors in how Vulkan is used can result in a crash. \n\nThe Khronos Valiation Layer can be enabled to assist development by enabling developers to verify their applications correctly use the Vulkan API.",
